# Skill Track App (React / Tailwind CSS)

This application is a modern, responsive web interface designed to help users track their learning journey, view their profile, and explore available course offerings. Built with React and styled using a dark, professional Tailwind CSS theme.

## Features

The Skill Track App is composed of three main sections, providing a complete overview of the user's learning status and options.

1. Learning Dashboard

A high-level overview of the user's performance and milestones:

Key Metrics: Displays crucial learning statistics, including courses enrolled, total completion percentage, total hours logged, and the next focus milestone.

Progress Visualization: Features detailed progress bars for specific subject areas (e.g., HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Backend) with percentage completion.


1. Course Catalog

A browsable list of courses available for enrollment:

Course Cards: Each course is displayed in a distinct, color-coded card indicating its level (Advanced, Core, Beginner), duration, and a brief description.

Aesthetic Design: Cards feature subtle group hover effects and corresponding background/text colors for high visual separation and clarity.

3. User Profile

A dedicated section for viewing personal and enrollment details:

Read-Only Data: Displays essential non-editable user information (Full Name, Email Address, Mobile Number).

Course Details: Clearly shows the currently enrolled course (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer") alongside an "Upgrade Course" call-to-action button.

Premium Theme: Utilizes a dark background with vibrant indigo and violet accents for a premium, high-contrast user experience.
